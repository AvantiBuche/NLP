# NLP

Natural language processing (NLP) givings computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.
Examples include machine translation, summarization, ticket classification, and spell check.
